# Interactive Show Enhancement for Dark Ride

This was my thesis project in undergrad. We worked in a group to retrofit the traditional "Haunted House" carnival dark ride by adding interactive elements translated onto a projector. The inspiration for this project was the Toy Story dark ride in Disney World where the idea is you gamify these types of rides to keep patrons engaged and avoid any potential vandalism.

This was done by applying gesture recognition algorithms and forced perspectives which interacted with the Unity3D engine using the Microsoft Kinect device.

You can find the final report in the respective folder of this repository for full details. There was a lot of self learning we had to do along with learning how Unity2D works such as Maya for building models and learning C# which was actually not that bad due to our extensive courses on learning OOP practises with Java.

## Features
- Squinching effects to give a forced perspective
- Gesture recognitions based on tracking key figure components the Kinect was able to track such as
- Hardware distance tracking with a microcontroller to help trigger certain events. 

## Dependencies, Libraries, and Wrappers

- Kinect SDK
- OpenNI2 NitE2
- Zigfu
